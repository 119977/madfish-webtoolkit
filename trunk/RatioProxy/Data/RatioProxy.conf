#Settings that you probably need to change:

#Calculations:
#NewDownload=DownloadValueSource*DownloadMultiplier
#NewUpload=UploadValueSource*UploadMultiplier
#For example, setting UploadValueSource to Download and UploadMultiplier to 1.5 will make transform NewUpload=OldDownload*1.5

#Download value source (Download,Upload)
DownloadValueSource Download
#Download multiplier
DownloadMultiplier 1.0

#Upload value source (Download,Upload)
UploadValueSource Download
#Upload multiplier
UploadMultiplier 1.07
