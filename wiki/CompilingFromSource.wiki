To compile !WebToolkit from source, you have to install [http://www.cmake.org/ cmake].

1. Check out code from svn:
{{{
svn checkout http://madfish-webtoolkit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ WebApps
}}}

2. Create build folder:
{{{
mkdir WebAppsBuild
cd WebAppsBuild
}}}

3. Invoke cmake.

For Windows (Visual Studio 2008)
{{{
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ..\WebApps
}}}

For Linux (by default it will use Unix makefiles, and that is ok)
{{{
cmake ../WebApps
}}}

4. Build.

 * For Windows: open generated Visual Studio solution, and run build.
 * For Linux: just run make.

5. Ok, you have the executable. Now take your data files and put it together with your executable. That's all.
